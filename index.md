### Louis Stevenson

Louis is hard to photograph, him being the photographer and all, but every once
and a while someone else will snap a shot. Like this one, of him on his rather
custom Triumph 675 build.

Louis wears many hats. Racer, Photographer, WMRRA Race Referee. You can find Louis
roaming around the track or paddock at any PNW race weekend.



# Thank you to all of the sponsors that support our racing.
