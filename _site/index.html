<h3 id="chris-wilcox"><a href="https://chriswilcox.racing/">Chris Wilcox</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/chris-2021-gearing-up.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Chris Wilcox is a regional road racer participating in <a href="https://wmrra.com">WMRRA</a> (Washington Motorcycle Road Racing Association) and <a href="https://omrra.com">OMRRA</a> (Oregon Motorcycle Road Racing Association), participating in Formula 600, 600 Supersport, and 600 Superbike clases.</p>

<p>Chris is also a long-time volunteer of WMRRA and serves on its Board of Directors. You can find him most race weekends at Friday night tech, making sure machinery and gear are in order for the weekendâ€™s events.</p>

<p>Chris is sponsored by <a href="https://chriswilcox.racing/img/sponsors/kyt.png">KYT</a> and <a href="https://tracktime.bike/">Track Time</a> where he instructs.</p>

<h3 id="louis-stevenson">Louis Stevenson</h3>

<p><img src="/img/20240527-TrackTime-Ridge-0865.jpg" height="500" /></p>

<p>Louis is hard to photograph, him being the photographer and all, but every once
and a while someone else will snap a shot. Like this one, of him on his rather
custom Triumph 675 build.</p>

<p>Louis wears many hats. Racer, Photographer, WMRRA Race Referee. You can find Louis
roaming around the track or paddock at any PNW race weekend.</p>
